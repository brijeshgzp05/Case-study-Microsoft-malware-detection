In this notebook I have tried to reproduce the results given by various experts tried to solve the problem.

Steps included :
1. Data collection : The data was collected from kaggle.
2. Exploratory data analysis : The were nine classes of malwares. For each malware two kinds of files were included byte file and asm file. The byte files contains hexadecimal 
codes and asm files contains asm codes of same byte file.
3. Feature extraction : From byte files mainly two features were extracted unigrams, bigrams and byet size array. From asm files we extracted opcodes unigram, bigram and trigrams.
Then we counted various keywords such as text, segment count etc. Then comes the golden feature. Image pixel feature. The asm files were converted to image and first 800 pixels were 
taken into consideration. 
4. Feature selection : Models like random forest was used to extract important features. The main objective to reduce the dimensionality.
5. Modelelling : Tried various models but XGBoost given the best results.
